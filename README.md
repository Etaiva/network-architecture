# network-architecture
A confident and clear guide to network architecture. Understand the basics of hardware, software, topologies, and design principles in a way that’s easy to follow and empowers you.

An Introduction to Network Architecture
Welcome to this repository! It’s designed to help you understand the fundamental categories and concepts of network architecture. No confusing jargon, just clear explanations to get you started.
At its heart, a network is built from two key ingredients: hardware and software.
Hardware Components
These are the physical, tangible parts of the network—the stuff you can actually see and touch.
•	Servers: Think of these as the main engines. They're powerful computers that store and manage all the data and resources, responding to requests from other devices.
•	Clients: This is your device—your laptop, phone, or desktop. It’s what you use to connect to the network and access its resources.
•	Networking Devices: This is a broad group of devices that help direct and manage data traffic.
o	Routers: These forward data between different networks.
o	Switches: These connect multiple devices within the same network.
o	Hubs: A simpler device that connects multiple machines and sends data to all of them.
•	Transmission Media: This is the physical pathway data takes, such as Ethernet and fibre-optic cables, or even Wi-Fi signals.
•	Data Storage: The physical devices that hold information, such as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Network-Attached Storage (NAS).
Software Components
This is the non-physical side of things—the rules, protocols, and programmes that make the hardware work together seamlessly.
•	Operating Systems: The software that controls a computer's hardware and resources. In a network, this includes Network Operating Systems (NOS) that run servers.
•	Protocols: These are the essential rules for communication.
o	TCP/IP: The fundamental rules for the internet.
o	HTTP: The protocol that powers web browsing.
•	Applications: The software you use to get things done, like your web browser or email client.
•	Data Storage Software: The logical systems that manage and organise data, such as a File System or a Database Management System (DBMS).
Other Key Concepts
Network architecture isn't just about hardware and software. We also classify networks by their size and structure.
•	Network Size:
o	PAN: A Personal Area Network for a single person's devices.
o	LAN: A Local Area Network for a small area, like an office.
o	MAN: A Metropolitan Area Network that covers a city.
o	WAN: A Wide Area Network that spans a large geographical area, like the internet.
•	Network Topology:
o	Physical Topology: The physical layout of the network's hardware.
o	Logical Topology: The path that data takes through the network, which may differ from the physical layout.
•	Network Design Principles: The guiding ideas for building a great network. Key principles include scalability (it can grow), reliability (it stays working), and security.
